How to structure this file:
{A||B}
{A||B}
...

A is the friendly name that will show up in the combo box when you run this program.

B is the shell command you pass in to run a program with the URL parameter. {URL} will be subsituted by the actual URL to the video in the program. It's recommended to put quotes around {URL} so the program will read the URL correctly. The program may treat different parts of the URL as different parameters if you don't.
For example, let's say the command "vlc" will run VLC, and inserting a video URL right after will open VLC and stream that video. Also you want the friendly name to be "VLC".
This is how you would write it:
{VLC||vlc "{URL}"}

Let's say you want to do the similar thing with Firefox with the command being "firefox" and the friendly name being "Firefox":
{Firefox||firefox "{URL}"}

If you want to specify multiple commands, you can do so by simply listing them:
{VLC||vlc "{URL}"}
{Firefox||firefox "{URL}"}
